# Exoplanet Data Analysis
This Python script analyses and visualises exoplanet data using the Pandas and Plotly Express libraries. The dataset, named 'exoplanet_confirm_and_candidates.csv', contains information about confirmed and candidate exoplanets.


## Visualisations
Orbital Period vs. Planet Mass: Scatter plot showing the relationship between the logarithm of orbital period and planet mass for confirmed exoplanets, colour-coded by stellar effective temperature.

Filtered: Orbital Period vs. Planet Mass: Similar to the previous plot, with a filter applied to remove hotter stars for better visualisation.

Orbital Period vs. Planet Mass (All): Scatter plot showing the relationship between the logarithm of orbital period and planet mass for all confirmed exoplanets.

Orbital Period vs. Planet Radius: Scatter plot for confirmed exoplanets with a temperature filter on radius, showing the relationship between the logarithm of orbital period and planet radius.
